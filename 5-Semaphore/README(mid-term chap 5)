AssignementLimitWorkers

In this exercise, I modified the line of code that creates the counting semaphore :

SemaphoreHandle_t sem = xSemaphoreCreateCounting(2, 2);

This change was made to test the case where we have four BlinkWorkers but only two tokens available.
As a result, only two BlinkWorker tasks can run at the same time, while the other two must wait until a token is released.
This demonstrates how the counting semaphore effectively limits concurrent task execution and helps control access to shared resources in FreeRTOS.
